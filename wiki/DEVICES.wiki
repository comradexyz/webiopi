=Device support and plans=

*With the upcoming release, you will be able to use Serial/I2C/SPI/1-Wire devices directly from the REST API without writing macros.*

To do this, WebIOPi need somes drivers that use a special Python function decorator. Low level acces to I2C/SPI/... is provided by lightweights classes available in the WebIOPi core without dependencies. Drivers simply use those classes, and the decorator to expose functions on the REST API. Configuration is then provided with a new [http://webiopi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/config /etc/webiopi/config] file.

I cannot write a driver for all components, mainly because I don't have them, and I cannot buy everything. I could write drivers simply reading specs, but I will not be able to certify it work.

Everything will be documented to help the community write drivers, and I hope people will submit some.
But I would like to include most used components I can hand on.

==Submit your devices==
Feel free to submit any component you use and/or would like to use with WebIOPi on the [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/webiopi/p1lfi0pIBFA/discussion discussion thread]. Depending on demands, I may write the driver it if I can have one sample. If possible, add a link to its datasheet.

==How to help==
If you absolutely need particular one, you can send/buy me a sample or make a [https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=79EM7ZV9FQ4HU donation], I will write the driver required.

If you know how the device work on it's low level interface, look on the [http://code.google.com/p/webiopi/source/checkout source repository], starting with [http://webiopi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/webiopi/devices/digital/pcf8574.py PCF8574], write your own and submit it.
