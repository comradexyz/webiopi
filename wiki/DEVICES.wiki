=Device support and plans=
This list summarize device support available in the next release and on the source repository.

*Submit your devices*
Feel free to submit any component you use and/or would like to use with WebIOPi on the [https://groups.google.com/d/topic/webiopi/p1lfi0pIBFA/discussion discussion thread].
Depending on demands, I may write the driver it if I can have one sample.
If possible, add a link to its datasheet.

*How to help ?*
If you absolutely need particular one, you can send/buy me a sample or make a donation, I will write the driver required.
If you know how the device work on it's low level interface, look on the [http://code.google.com/p/webiopi/source/checkout source repository], start with [http://webiopi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/webiopi/devices/digital.py PCF8574 driver], write your own and submit it.
