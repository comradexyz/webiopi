=Usage=
First of all, follow [INSTALL installation instructions].

If your are directly using your Raspberry Pi with keyboard/mouse/display plugged,  open a browser to http://localhost/webiopi/

If your Raspberry Pi is connected to your network, yo can open a browser to http://raspberrypi/webiopi/ with any device of your network. Replace raspberrypi by its IP if DNS don't find raspberrypi.

_Don't forget to add :port right after raspberrypi/IP if you use a different port._

You can even add a port redirection on your router (and/or use IPv6) to control your GPIOs over Internet !
