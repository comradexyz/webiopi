===WebIOPi is a fully integrated Internet of Things framework for the Raspberry Pi.===
  * Control, debug, and use your Pi's GPIO locally or remotely, from a browser or any app.
  * WebIOPi is the perfect Swiss-knife to make connected things with the Raspberry Pi.
  * Developed and provided by Eric PTAK, french R&D engineer in networks, software, and Internet of Things.

===Features===
  * REST API over HTTP and CoAP (draft-14) with multicast support
  * Server written in Python with zero dependency
  * Supports GPIO, Serial, I2C, SPI, 1-Wire with zero dependency
  * Supports more than [DEVICES 30 devices] including DAC, ADC, sensors...
  * Full Python library for the Server, GPIO, Serial, I2C, SPI and devices drivers
  * Compatible with both Python 2 and 3
  * Extensible and highly customizable
  * Login/Password protection
  * Mobile devices compatible
  * Includes debug web apps
    * GPIO Header
    * GPIO List
    * Serial Monitor
    * Devices Monitor
  * Javascript client library built on top of jQuery
  * Python client library with HTTP and CoAP support

===What for===
  * Use webiopi.GPIO library to control GPIO in your Python scripts
  * Use devices drivers to interact with DAC, ADC, sensors and more in your Python scripts
  * Use Serial, I2C and SPI webiopi classes in your Python scripts
  * Use the GPIO Header web-app to play with GPIO and debug circuits
  * Use the Serial Monitor web-app to debug Serial devices
  * Use the Devices Monitor web-app to debug devices like DAC, ADC, sensors and more
  * Create a web-app with the Javascript library to remote controls things connected on GPIO
  * Add webiopi in your existing Python script to simply add all WebIOPi features
  * Extends webiopi with your own macro
  * Extends webiopi with scripts loading facilities in a Arduino fashion way (setup, loop, destroy)
  * Use the Python Client to make Pi-2-Pi communication through the REST API
  * Use the Python Multicast Client to control multiple Pis with a single REST call
  * Use the Java Client to use the REST API from a Java application, including Android
  * Use the REST API from any technology/language
