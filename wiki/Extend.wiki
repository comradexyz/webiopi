The new Server [Configuration] file allows to load customs Python scripts for advanced configuration or computation. You can write your scripts with an Arduino sketch-like format using setup/loop/destroy functions. Macro registering to the REST API has been simplified as it only requires to add @macro before each macro definition.

{{{
import webiopi
GPIO = webiopi.GPIO
LED = 25

def setup():
    GPIO.setFunction(LED, GPIO.OUT)

def loop():
    value = not GPIO.digitalRead(LED)
    GPIO.digitalWrite(LED, value)
    webiopi.sleep(5)        

def destroy():
    GPIO.setFunction(LED, GPIO.IN)

@macro
def Hello(first, last):
    return "Hello %s %s !" % (first, last)
}}}

Anyone should be able to use the included library without changing their habits and extend WebIOPi without worrying about the Server. As usual, make a POST to /macros/Hello/Eric,PTAK to call the macro or use one of the client.
