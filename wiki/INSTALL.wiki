You have the choice of the install, regards on wich technology you prefer : PHP or Pyhton.
But don't use different server at the same time, or it may not work correctly.
  * PHP version is good if you already have Apache/PHP or if you plan to use it, but requires some configuration.
  * Python version if preferable for one time use,  or for users who don't want to install and/or modify Apache configuration files.

==PHP==
Requires Apache2 and PHP5 on you Pi, and also some tweaks.

First install required packages :
{{{
$ aptitude install apache2 php5
}}}
Then download and extract WebIOPi to /var/www

In order to work, PHP version of WebIOPi requires to allow .htaccess :
{{{
$ nano /etc/apache2/site-enabled/000-default
}}}
Find the "<Directory /var/www>" section and change the line "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All" :
{{{
﻿  <Directory /var/www/>
﻿  ﻿  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
﻿  ﻿  AllowOverride All
﻿  ﻿  Order allow,deny
﻿  ﻿  allow from all
﻿  </Directory>
}}}
﻿  
You will also need to add apache's user (www-data) to the sudoers :
{{{
$ sudo visudo
}}}
then add the following line at the end of file :
{{{
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
}}}

Exit, save, and confirm changes.

You can now open a browser to http://raspberrypi/webiopi/  (or replace raspberrypi by your Pi's IP)
  

==PYTHON==
Requires [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO/ RPi.GPIO] module. You will also need Python development headers.

On Raspbian, with root user  (or using sudo):
{{{
$ aptitude install python-dev
}}}

Then download & install the module :
{{{
$ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/RPi.GPIO/RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.tar.gz
$ cd RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a
$ python setup.py install
}}}

To install WebIOPi, just download and extract the archive wherever you want.

To run it, open a terminal in the directory you extracted WebIOPi, and start the server process with root/sudo : 
{{{
$ python webiopi.py [port]
or
$ ./webiopi.py [port]
}}}
where port is the port to bind the HTTP server, default is 80, but maybe used by Apache.

You can now open a browser to http://raspberrypi[:port]/ (or replace raspberrypi by your Pi's IP)
