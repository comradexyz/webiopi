You will need Python development headers. On Raspbian, open a terminal :
{{{
$ sudo aptitude install python-dev
}}}

Now download and extract WebIOPi :
{{{
$ tar xvzf WebIOPi-X.Y.tar.gz
$ cd WebIOPi-X.Y
$ sudo ./setup.sh
}}}

Finally, run the python script :
{{{
$ sudo python -m webiopi [port]
}}}
where port is the port to bind the HTTP server, default is 8000.

You're done, and ready to enjoy WebIOPi ! But the server and GPIO state will be lost when you'll stop the script (CTRL-C) or close the terminal session.

You can also start/stop as a background service :
{{{
$ sudo /etc/init.d/webiopi start
and
$ sudo /etc/init.d/webiopi stop
}}}

You can setup your system to start webiopi at startup :
{{{
$ sudo update-rc.d webiopi defaults
}}}
